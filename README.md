# webpentestsql
An implementation of some SQL exploits and command execution for the Web for Pentesters server ISO image.  

This Python3 code was written as part of an assignment for coursework taken at the University of New Orleans.
It can completely take control of a server as run from the Web for Pentesters ISO image (https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/web_for_pentester/course).
It does this by being able to use SQL injection to scrape databases, and code and command injection to run server-side commands.
Additionally, it can upload and download files in order to extract or replace server files.

# Dependencies
This code makes use of the following libraries and can be easially installed using "pip install package-name"<br>
beautifulsoup<br>
Requests<br>
Pandas<br>
Lxml<br>
Html5lib<br>
Tabulate<br>
 
# lab3sh.py
This acts as a remote shell, taking the server address as an argument when run.
It can run most commands, and can be passed ';' to chain commands for complex operations.  Piping does not work as of initial release.
Additionally, it can run the following special commands:<br>
download "remote_file" "local_file" <br>
upload "local_file" "remote_file" <br>
download will upload a generic PHP downloader script to the server, then run remote commands so that the remote file will be copied to a public directory where the PHP script is so that it can be downloaded as part of an HTTP GET request.<br>
upload will upload a given file an then run remote commands so that it is placed where it is desired.

# lab3sqli.py
This acts as simple shell for crafting SQL injections so that database information can be manipulated and retrieved.
The following commands can be run:<br>
dbs -Lists all databases on the server.<br>
tables "database" -Lists tables for given database.<br>
columns "database" "table" -Lists the column names for a given table in a database<br>
dump "database" "table" -Prints out the table to command line. Future versions will support CSV file output.

# dl.php
A simple PHP downloader script that will allow for download of any file passed as an argument. This allows for download of PHP scripts where the web server will want to execute PHP scripts instead of serving them as file.

The original report made for the assignment.  Gives some insight into why I made some of the design choices I did given the assignment objectives, and also why I used the external libraries I did.
